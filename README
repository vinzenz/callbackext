Author: Vinzenz Feenstra 
Email:  evilissimo@users.sourceforge.net

This is an extended callback library. It provides
diffrent possibilities of usage. 

There are functors for up to 10 parameters.
There are delegates for up to 10 Parameters, too.
Easy usage with an overloaded delegate / functor creator
template function which is overloaded for every case.

There are "containers" like the DelegateList or the 
Associative.
